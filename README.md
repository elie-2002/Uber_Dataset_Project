📘 About This Project
In this project, I worked with a real-world dataset from Uber rides to understand how prices change based on distance, time, and location. I used Python to clean and prepare the data, and then used Power BI to build a visual dashboard to help people see the patterns and trends in Uber fares.

📂 Dataset & Tools Used

Dataset Source: Uber Fares Dataset on Kaggle

Data Cleaning & Processing: Python (Pandas)

Visualization Tool: Power BI Desktop

My Kaggle Notebook:(https://www.kaggle.com/code/nshimyumuremyielias/assignment-by-using-kaggle/edit)

🔍 Project Steps
1️⃣ Understanding the Data
2️⃣ Data Transformation
3️⃣ Building the Dashboard

Using Power BI, I created the following visualizations:

Fare distribution chart

Distance vs Fare chart

Time of day analysis

Rides per weekday

Monthly ride count

Pickup map of NYC

🧽 For Cleaning Process

python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("uber_fares.csv")  # adjust filename as needed
print(df.head())
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())
